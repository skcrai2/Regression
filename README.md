# Regression
Using regression to answer the question: Can you accurately predict insurance costs based on the collected data points?  What predictors are most valuable in determining medical costs?

Here's the project:

Build the best predictive model you can from the insurance dataset provided and provide the following:  

Description of the data set (tell us about it, what's going on, when it was collected and why, why it's important, the nature of the variables (what they mean, etc.);

Description of what you're trying to do with the data and why... to whom would your model potentially be of use?

Diagnostics (checking for equal variance, serial correlation, curvature, non-normality of residuals, etc.);

Check for outliers and leverage points, etc.

Methods you use to address the diagnostics (like weighted least squares, transformations of the response or predictors, etc.)

Provide confidence interval estimates of the model parameters. 

Build the model (are you using method of best subsets, or forward or backward regression, lasso, or ridge methods?)... also are you using polynomial or broken stick regression?

Include all R code, charts & graphs, and output.

Provide a conclusion/summary of your findings. 

The provided r code includes all of the above
